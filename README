Simple CSV (comma-separated values) format parser for Perl 6.

  use v6;
  use Text::CSV;

  say Text::CSV.read-file('somefile.csv').perl;
  say Text::CSV.read("foo,bar\nbaz,boo").perl;

Oh, and the C<read> methods take this flag:

    :trim        Removes whitespace on both ends of each value.

    :skip-header Causes the first line not to be included in the output.

    :output      Determines the shape of the returned data structure.
                 Allowed values are 'arrays' (the default) and 'hashes'.
                 When the value is 'hashes', the first line is assumed
                 to be a special header line, the values on that
                 line are used as hash keys, and :skip-header is suppressed.

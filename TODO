Some new ideas await tuits:

* Fields with embedded double-quote characters must be enclosed within
  double-quote characters, and each of the embedded double-quote
  characters must be represented by a pair of double-quote characters.

* Fields with embedded line breaks must be enclosed within double-quote
  characters. Need to support this.

* The first record in a csv file may contain column names in each of
  the fields. So, the plan is to have a 'header' flag, which treats the
  first line specially, and makes CSV output an AoH instead of an AoA.

* Ooh, scratch the above idea, and make :header a more general :output
  named param, where :output<hash> corresponds to the AoH idea. Then,
  :output(SomeType) can create an AoO instead, each row corresponding to
  one SomeType instantiation.

* While we're at it, there could be a :strict flag that's off by default
  in the :output<array> (default) case, but on for :output<hash> and
  :output(SomeType). If it's turned off, keys will be missing (if there
  are too few columns) or dropped (if there are too many), but hey, that's
  what the user asked for.

Some new ideas await tuits:

* There could be a :strict flag that's off by default
  in the :output<array> (default) case, but on for :output<hash> and
  :output(SomeType). If it's turned off, keys will be missing (if there
  are too few columns) or dropped (if there are too many), but hey, that's
  what the user asked for.

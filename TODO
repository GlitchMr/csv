Some new ideas await tuits:

* According to <http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Comma-separated_values>,
  "In some CSV implementations, leading and trailing spaces or tabs,
  adjacent to commas, are trimmed. This practice is contentious and in
  fact is specifically prohibited by RFC 4180, which states, "Spaces are
  considered part of a field and should not be ignored." Seems a wise
  course of action is to make spaces and tabs significant by default,
  but add a 'trim' flag to the class.

* Similarly, make single quotes not quote things by default. Perhaps
  not even a flag is needed in this case.

* Fields with embedded double-quote characters must be enclosed within
  double-quote characters, and each of the embedded double-quote
  characters must be represented by a pair of double-quote characters.

* Fields with embedded line breaks must be enclosed within double-quote
  characters. Need to support this.

* The first record in a csv file may contain column names in each of
  the fields. So, the plan is to have a 'header' flag, which treats the
  first line specially, and makes CSV output an AoH instead of an AoA.

Some new ideas await tuits:

* Similarly, make single quotes not quote things by default. Perhaps
  not even a flag is needed in this case.

* Fields with embedded double-quote characters must be enclosed within
  double-quote characters, and each of the embedded double-quote
  characters must be represented by a pair of double-quote characters.

* Fields with embedded line breaks must be enclosed within double-quote
  characters. Need to support this.

* The first record in a csv file may contain column names in each of
  the fields. So, the plan is to have a 'header' flag, which treats the
  first line specially, and makes CSV output an AoH instead of an AoA.
